--🔍 Introduction
--In this project, I explored a fictional Fortune 500 dataset using SQL, applying real-world data analysis techniques to uncover patterns and insights. The dataset includes information on company revenue, number of employees, employee benefits, and average tenure. The goal was to develop five meaningful questions that demonstrate core SQL skills, such as filtering, calculations, conditional logic, and aggregations.

--By analyzing employee benefits and retention trends across industries, I aimed to highlight companies with strong workplace practices and identify areas with potential room for improvement. Below are the five questions I explored and the insights I uncovered.


--Which companies in the 'Technology' or 'Retail' industries do not offer healthcare benefits?

SELECT company_name, industry, healthcare_benefits 
FROM fortune_companies 
WHERE industry IN ('Technology', 'Retail') 
AND healthcare_benefits = 0;
--📌 Insight: A small number of companies in these two major sectors still don’t offer healthcare benefits, which is surprising given industry standards. This may affect their ability to attract and retain top talent.

--What is the revenue per employee for each company?

SELECT company_name, revenue, employees, (revenue / employees) AS revenue_per_employee 
FROM fortune_companies;
--📌 Insight: Revenue per employee gives a quick view into company efficiency. Companies with high revenue and fewer employees typically have more scalable or capital-intensive models.
    
--Categorize companies based on their average employee tenure:

SELECT company_name, avg_employee_tenure,
CASE
WHEN avg_employee_tenure >= 7 THEN 'High Retention'
WHEN avg_employee_tenure >= 5 THEN 'Moderate Retention'
ELSE 'Low Retention'
END AS retention_category
FROM fortune_companies;
--📌 Insight: This classification shows how loyal employees are to their companies. High retention often signals a positive work culture, while low retention may indicate high turnover or limited career development opportunities.
    
--What is the average maternity leave offered per industry (only including industries where the average is more than 10 weeks)?

SELECT industry, AVG(maternity_leave_weeks) AS avg_maternity_leave
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY industry
HAVING AVG(maternity_leave_weeks) > 10;
--📌 Insight: Industries like Technology and Healthcare tend to offer longer maternity leave, reflecting evolving expectations around family support. These benefits are increasingly valued by modern employees.

--Find all companies that offer both at least 20 paid days off and 12 or more weeks of maternity leave.

SELECT company_name, paid_time_off_days, maternity_leave_weeks 
FROM fortune_companies 
WHERE paid_time_off_days >= 20 
AND maternity_leave_weeks >= 12;
--📌 Insight: These companies are more likely to be perceived as family-friendly and progressive. Strong benefits like these contribute significantly to employee satisfaction and loyalty.

--✅ Conclusion
--This analysis highlighted how SQL can be used to extract actionable insights from corporate data. From identifying gaps in employee benefits to recognizing trends in employee tenure, I was able to apply core data analysis techniques — filtering, calculations, conditional logic, grouping, and aggregation — to explore real-world business concerns.

--Understanding these patterns can help businesses improve employee retention, remain competitive, and build better workplaces. Projects like this simulate the day-to-day tasks of a data analyst and demonstrate how SQL is a powerful tool for driving decisions based on data.
